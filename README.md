##IT4IT
The IT4IT Reference Architecture prescribes holistic management of the business of IT with continuous insight and control, enabling Boundaryless Information Flow™ across the entire IT Value Chain.

The Open Group IT4IT Reference Architecture standard comprises a reference architecture and a value chain-based operating model for managing the business of IT.  It provides prescriptive guidance on how to design, procure and implement the functionality needed to run IT. The end-to-end, ‘how to’ emphasis of the IT Value Chain and IT4IT Reference Architecture also enables the state of services that IT delivers to be systematically tracked across the service lifecycle.
